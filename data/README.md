Emotional-Belief Expresion Coding Analysis

Emotional-Belief Expression Analysis (EBA) is a coding method used in Advocacy Coalition Framework studies to better understand the emotions and beliefs of coalitions. It is a variation of past ACF belief coding and utilizes Philip Liefeld's Discourse Network Analyzer.

Applications for EBA are suitable for any study of discourse and has been applied to newsmedia, legislative testimony, and interview data. The approach was built from past Advocacy Coalition Framework belief studies and includes the efforts of Allegra Fullerton, Kayla Gabehart, Jill Yordy, Emma Scheetz, Anna Crawford, Anna Durnov√°, and Chris Weible.

To apply EBA, download the above codebook and thesaurus. Tutotials for using DNA are included on Liefeld's git.
